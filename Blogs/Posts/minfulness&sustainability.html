        <h1>Mindfulness and Sustainability</h1>
        <h2>Becoming Resourceful in a World of Consumerism</h2>
        <img src="Images/mindfulness.png" alt="Rocks stacked on top of eachother with a bamboo background">
            <p>
                    When people think of personal sustainability, they think of the newly crocheted grocery bag, that bamboo toothbrush, the sustainable makeup products, or the chic minimalistic wardrobe.
                <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                    For those who are on the lower income strata in our capitalistic hierarchy like myself, a lot of these items are unattainable, inaccessible, and often time not affordable. So how can we be personally sustainable if we are poor and might not even be driving as often as the rich folk who produce the highest carbon footprint? Why should it matter to us? 
                <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                    See, the environment does not have a justice system. Whether we like it or not, what we breathe, how it accumulates, and where it goes will not have a sense of morality attached to it. Oftentimes, those with the highest personal responsibility to take care of the environment are the ones who are being affected the most by it while those who have less of a personal responsibility aren’t. For those who are rich and I mean someone who owns a car, has a good-paying job, and can afford vacations and trips, I think your energies could be put elsewhere when it comes to the power of your responsibility. You can afford to donate to local causes, pay for environmentally sustainable clothing, and make better choices for both your money and the planet like installing solar panels. Everyone else has other things to take care of and it’s not saving up for that minimalist-styled makeup. 
                <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                    Since most of us can’t afford the most sustainable, long-lasting, high-quality products we are going to have to get to work on our spending habits. Say goodbye to your wishlist because we are going to focus on your mindset about what you want as an environmentally-conscious person and why you want it.
                <br>
            </p>
                    Let's go back to that makeup example (I am currently into makeup right now as you can tell), I used to research extra hard on sustainable packaging. It had to be packaged in biodegradable material, it’s a plus if it’s reusable, and the ingredients had to be clean. All the while, I was putting my old makeup with its plastic tubing and packaging in a bin somewhere else. 
                <br>
            <p>
                    That makeup wasn’t bad per say. Although you could argue as to the ingredients of what some of them contained they were still usable and guess what? Where did they go when they eventually expired? The trash. THE. TRASH. 
                <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                    Look, I don’t have infinite money to keep buying these nice high-quality makeup products, I have enough to save up and go purchase them eventually but until then what do I use for self-love and expression hmm? Oh yeah, let’s go to the CVS. 
                <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                    Use your items carefully, love your items. I believe in having a relationship with your stuff. You can call it materialistic but with anything that has a label, I think that occurs when things go overboard and there is a form of addiction. What I am advocating for is a love for what you have now. That half-empty concealer from Physician Formula? Girl enjoy it! Maximize it! If it’s possible to recycle it, please do so. Do you know what gets us out of not caring for the environment? Being miserable. Do what you can with what you have. I apply that to veganism too and most of life in general. Things are a slow process and we have to acknowledge the limitations that surround us so that we can work around them. 
                <br>
            </p>
                    Yeah, I dropped that veganism topic there, I don’t care. I’ll get to it in another blog. For now, let's focus on that relationship with your products and maximize their potential. 
                <br>
            <p>
                    Ask yourself: 
                    Could you maximize your items while still having that same return in value if you weren’t being frugal? 
                    Are you sure there aren’t cheaper options than that sustainable product you wish to purchase? 
                    Is this product greenwashing? 
                    Are you sure you just can’t fix that item? Why not build a skill on fixing that item? Do you have better stuff to do or are you just being lazy? 
                <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                    Ultimately, the extension of your items varies upon that item and your willingness to extend that item. We all have that one item we never throw away. Why? Does it carry sentimental value? Is it still functiona? Can it survive a hurricane? Think of that object and now apply it to the rest. 
                    Once that has been done, we can now move on and actually throw the things where their potential has been maxed out. In a way, we can clear our minds and think less of what we don’t have and more of what have in the end.

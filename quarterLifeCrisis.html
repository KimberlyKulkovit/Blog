        <h1>To Be in the Shit: A Quarter-Life Crisis</h1>
        <p>
            First and foremost, I am in the middle of it. I didn’t solve being out of a quarter-life crisis so if you want someone like that, please click away. However, there’s something special about being in it and how once things are solved, people can forget the rut. And who wouldn’t blame them? It is such an awful experience. 

            I will show you, from basket case to basket case, how to at least know yourself and be confident in that. Now, making those dreams come true or having those dreams become feasible in our world is going to be another discussion. Let’s remember, what used to work traditionally may no longer work for others based on the present technologies replacing jobs. We have already seen the tech layoffs and finally, we have protests from actors and writers standing up against the meager wage they’ve dealt with. These are the real reasons people don’t follow their dreams. Sure, few are not confident in their pursuit and the cold hard truth is that’s a therapy problem they’d have to work through. The real issue for most of us unrequited dreamers is that we want a living wage and a work-life balance. We want to support ourselves. 

            Onto the second thing that a few readers (or maybe most depending on my stats) will be able to relate to being neurodivergent in a capitalistic world is a killer. Frankly, having a disability of any kind, especially a mental illness makes it considerably harder for some to find a job, keep a job, or both. Yep, that 9 - 5 job with shit sleep and an inability to find energy for making meaningful friendships outside of the workplace - yeah, that’s killing you. It’s the shit sleep for me and then having to use all my energy to fake being happy and loving my job. I am so happy I’m out of it. Oh, by the way, a lot of us end up going underemployed or unemployed. Isn’t that funny (sarcasm)? Growing up I was told that those who were bullied, quiet, but very smart academically were going to be rich CEOs that would later own their bullies but either that happened for the boomers or it was just something to alleviate the pain of being a misfit in school. Well, there’s no point in crying over spilled milk. We can’t continue being sorrowful of the past. If you are grieving from a recent diagnosis you must do so thoroughly and then come back to this blog once you have done so. 

	        So it all started right after high school. The dream problem that is. I was trying to figure out what I wanted to do with my life but, at the time, I was dealing with mental health problems. This is common for some teenagers and is important to note. I was into poetry, literature, writing, and film. I loved stories and enjoyed every medium to communicate stories. My film teacher knew how much I loved films and would personally let me borrow a few of his so I could watch them on my own time (some movies weren’t able to cut his class) and it was one of the few times I had someone support my interests. The film has always been something I loved to do during my past-time. I know this is controversial but as a South LA girl my stepfather at the time would grab me a stack of pirated movies and I’d watch and review them for my uncle. Going to the movies was too expensive for my family so this was my best bet for watching them and I just didn’t know any better. I was a kid. My uncle always asked me which of the films I’d recommend. I’d give him my recommendation. I loved this and I also loved books too. I even started my creative writing club in high school. So, understandably, when I was asked the question, what do I want to pursue in college? I said, “I want to be a writer.” My god was that an awful blow for my mother. In our little apartment in the ghetto neighborhood in South LA and now being a single mother, nope nope nope. This cannot happen. A computer technician in his 20s came by to offer me guidance. He told me that I could choose any other career path and do writing on the side. See, the thing is, I should have said I wanted to do storytelling because what happened after is a list of storytelling jobs I favored: 
            Novelist
            Poet 
            Musician 
            Manga artist 
            Short story writer 
            Director 
            I am finally at the director stage as I write. All the while I pursued careers in something I thought would be noble to follow which is climate change science. I had a long but very hard career in this pursuit because of my autistic disability until I realized I needed accommodations in the workplace and the journey I was in could not let that happen. So I am studying tech because I read that there are more accommodations for autistic people in this industry along with more of us in that field. 
            So far, it’s not so bad but I couldn’t help but feel like I lost sight of that side gig I agreed to do and now the main question is here: should I stop treating my true passion as a side gig for fiscal reasons or should I continue trying to balance both? 

            I see the protests of today with writers and actors. I commend them for their fight but, to be frank, it looks like if I pursue this challenge I will be poor for some more time. Now my mom is older and wants a house, talk about children is already occurring, tech layoffs make it daunting for me to get a nice living to support my passions. Yeah, I can see it. People are telling me to give up already. It’s too late. Do something else. Stick to tech, I’ve gotten pretty far. See, all these decisions are logical but not personable and I know the decision I’ll make is a personal one. 

            I know things aren’t too late but can someone help answer the question? Should I risk it all and pursue directing? Should I experiment some more until I genuinely realize what to do with my storytelling skills? Should I see if directing is my calling while pursuing tech as a safe base? I’m sticking to the latter right now but any advice would be appreciated.
